app can be launched with docker-compose or kubernetes

to launch the app on AWS EC2, launch an t2.medium instance (or better)
edit incoming rules for ports of frontend and backend (default 3000 & 5000 in docker compose, 30082 & 30085 in kubernetes)

connect to instance with ssh and download docker, 
docker-compose and kubernetes with commands from commands.txt

download the repository with deployment files
git clone https://github.com/JakubMroz4/DAT515-H23-cloud-computing

for both docker-compose and kubernetes you have to change the APIURL env variable for frontend / frontend-deployment
it has to match the ip/port of the backend, on EC2 it is the public ip. 
Default port is either 5000 (docker-compose) or 30085 (kubernetes).

When starting deployment with kubernetes start with db files and wait a moment to let db initialize.
Then continue with backend and frontend.
